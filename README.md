# Laravel Usage Guide

This is a step-by-step guide to setting up and running a Laravel application with Nuxt.js.

## Initial Preparation

1. Make sure your machine meets the system requirements to run Laravel. You need PHP, MySQL, and other supporting components. See the Laravel documentation for more information on system requirements.

2. Create a new database named "laravel_nuxt" in MySQL or adjust to your preference.

## Installation and Configuration

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` with the following command:
`cp .env.example .env`

2. Open the `.env` file and configure the database settings. Adjust the parameters as follows:
 - DB_CONNECTION=mysql
 - DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
 - DB_PORT=3306
 - DB_DATABASE=laravel_nuxt
 - D B_USERNAME=root
 - DB_PASSWORD=

Be sure to fill in `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` according to your database settings.

3. Run the following command to install all PHP dependencies via Composer:
`composer install`

4. Run the following command to generate the application key:
`php artisan key:generate`

5. Run the following command to run migrations and seed the database with seed data:
`php artisan migrate --seed`

This will create the necessary tables in the database and populate it with initial seed data.

## Running the Application

1. Run the Laravel development server with the following command:
`php artisan serve --port=8000`

This will run a local development server at `http://localhost:8000`.

2. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to see the running Laravel application.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your MySQL server is running.
- If you encounter problems running the `php artisan` command, make sure PHP has been added to your system's PATH.

This is a simple guide to running a Laravel application with Nuxt.js. You can customize these steps according to your project's needs. For more information on developing with Laravel, you can refer to the official Laravel documentation.
